# Empirical project on the Airbnb housing market

__Empirical project on the topic of Airbnb housing market__

## Motivation

As a result of this global connectivity and increased travelling frequency the pioneering platform of AirBnB has been established as the leader in online lodging, primarily home stays for vacation rentals and tourism activities with more than 2.8 million hosts (2021). Nevertheless, increased offer comes with increased competition and the hosts need to find new ways of attracting the people.

## Method and results

For this research, a pivot table and two plots were used in order to see the relationship between the variables. 

## Repository overview

This repository consists of the following folders and files: 
1) ***src folder*** that includes two subfolders: ***Analysis*** and ***Data_prep***
2) The ***Analysis*** folder includes makefile, pivot table, and two plots
3) The ***Data_prep*** folder includes clean file, download file, and makefile
4) There are also three separate files .gitignore, README.md, and makefile


## Running instructions

For this research was used R and RStudio software. Useful information about the software and guidelines about the installation process can be found [here](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/configure-your-computer/statistics-and-computation/r/). Moreover, to run the automated pipeline, you should install Make which you can do by following the guidelines provided [here](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/configure-your-computer/automation-and-workflows/make/). 

Additionally, the different library packages that should be used in RStudio are provided in each of the files. Without installing these packages, you cannot run the codes.
